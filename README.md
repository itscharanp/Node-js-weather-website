## Description

Re-created a simple weather website using Node.js, Express, and Axios for submitting an API request to MapQuest and DarkSky to retrieve location information and the current weather, respectively.

### Deployed :calling:

This app is deployed to [Heroku](https://itscharanp-fweatherapp.herokuapp.com/).

### Note :electric_plug:

You will need to sign up for an API key at [MapQuest](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/) and [DarkSky](https://api.weatherstack.com//) to use this app locally via your localhost. Create a `.env` file in the root folder to store your keys and access them using the `dotenv` package.

### Installing :electric_plug:

After downloading or cloning the repo perform the following steps:

Open the project folder at the root in your terminal and run `npm install` to download the dependencies needed for this project.

Next, type `node src/app.js` to run the Express server which defaults to localhost:3000.
